% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
We report time-delays, lensing amplifications and extinction estimates for the first resolved multiply-imaged Type Ia supernova iPTF16geu using \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) observations, as well as supporting ground-based data. Time-delay measurements of strongly lensed supernovae may become a powerful technique for measuring the Hubble constant, the parameter with the largest tension in precision cosmology. Furthermore, the resolved multi-band images provide unique information about the lensing galaxy, as well as the differential dimming due to dust in the lines of sight piercing the foreground galaxy. Using HST and Keck AO reference images taken after the SN faded below detection, we  obtain a refined estimate of the total lensing amplification for iPTF16geu,  $\mu = 63.8^{+3.9}_{-5.0}$, after corrections for extinction in the host and lensing galaxy.
As expected from the great symmentry of the system, we measure very short  time-delays for the three fainter images with respect to the brightest one: -0.81$\pm$ 0.80, -2.64 $\pm$ 1.5 and -0.164 $\pm$ 2.01 days.  Interestingly, we find large differences between the magnifications of the four supernova images, even after accounting for uncertainties in the extinction corrections:  $\Delta m_1 = -3.91^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$,   $\Delta m_2 =  -2.87^{+0.14}_{-0.15}$,  $\Delta m_3 = -2.19^{+0.75}_{-0.33}$ and  $\Delta m_4 = -2.11^{+1.40}_{-0.45}$ mag. The  large scatter requires additional gravitation lensing by substructures, micro- or millilensing (or some other mechanism) in addition to the large scale lens causing the observed image separations. 
Lighcurve fits of the resolved  multi-color observations are used to measure  
the total-to-selective absorption ratio, $R_V$, for the four lines of sight through the lensing galaxy. For three of the images we find significantly lower than the Milky Way average value.

\section{Introduction}
The discovery of the first multiply-imaged gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia), iPTF16geu \citep[][hereafter G17]{2017Sci...356..291G} was a major breakthrough for time-domain astronomy, highlighting the power of wide-field surveys to detect rare phenomena.  Transient astrophysical sources that are strongly lensed by foreground galaxies or galaxy clusters are powerful probes in cosmology since they make it possible to measure relative time delays between the multiple images. More than half a century has passed since \citet{1964MNRAS.128..307R} proposed that time-delays between multiple images of transients like supernovae (SNe) are useful since they depend sensitively on both cosmological parameters, e.g. the Hubble constant (H$_0$). The observations allow us also to probe the distribution of matter in the lens. Hence, multiply-resolved gravitationally lensed supernovae (\glsne) are exquisite laboratories for fundamental physics, as well as astrophysical properties of the host and lens galaxies. Although several strongly lensed galaxies and quasars have been discovered, \glsne have notable advantages, particularly if they're of Type Ia (glSNe~Ia). This is because the ``standard candle" nature of the SNe~Ia allows us to directly measure the magnification factor, which can allow us to overcome various degeneracies in estimating H$_0$ from strongly lensed transients, including the mass-sheet degeneracy \citep{1985ApJ...289L...1F,2014A&A...564A.103S}.

However, discovering these rare events has proven very challenging and it is only thanks to the recent developments in time domain astronomy that the first couple of resolved lensed supernovae have been detected. SN Refsdal \citep{2015Sci...347.1123K}, detected with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), is a core-collapse \sn magnified by a cluster of galaxies, which makes the lens modelling extremely challenging \citep{2018ApJ...860...94G}. 

The discovery of iPTF16geu showed that glSNe~Ia can be found without the need of highly spatially resolved observations, thanks to their "standard candle" nature. At $z=0.409$, the \sn was found to be 30 standard deviations too bright compared with the \snia population, which prompted us to observe the system from space with HST and with adaptive optics (AO) at VLT and Keck. Here we report on the multi-wavelength follow-up observations carried out while the \sn was active in late 2016, as well as laser aided AO Near IR observations with Keck and HST observations after the SN had faded below the detection limit.
We use the multi-wavelength light curves from the resolved images in combination with unresolved, ground-based data to constrain the magnifications of the individual SN images (and hence, the total SN magnification) after accounting for the extinction in the different lines of sight to the multiple images. 
 


The accurate \sn image positions are used to model the lens, as described in an accompanying paper (M{\"o}rtsell et al, in prep). Unlike the case of strongly lensed quasars, as the transient faded, we had an opportunity to verify the lensing model with the reconstruction of the distorted host galaxy image. 
By comparing the model predictions of the flux ratios between \sn images the observed values after extinction correction for each image, we assess the possibility that otherwise unaccounted for residuals are caused by lensing of substructures within the lensing galaxy, i.e., microlensing or millilensing.  
In another accompanying paper (Johansson et al, in prep) we present the spectroscopic observations of \geu.

The structure of this paper is as follows. We present the observations of iPTF16geu in Section~\ref{sec:data} and the photometry in Section~\ref{sec:photometry}. In Section~\ref{sec:lcmodel}, we describe the multiple-image SN model and the resulting lensing amplification, time-delays and constraints on extinction properties in Section~\ref{sec:results}. We present the observed magnifications in context of model predictions and discuss the possibility of substructures in Section~\ref{sec:substructure} and discuss observations of future strongly lensed SNe in Section~\ref{sec:forecast}. Finally, we present our conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
\section{Observations}
\label{sec:data}
\subsection{Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3}
We observed \geu with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera~3 (\wfc) in under programs DD~14862 and 
GO~15276 (PI: A.~Goobar) using the ultra violet (\wfcuvis) and (\wfcir) channels.  For both channels we only read out part, 
$512\times512$ pixels, of the full detectors.  However, given the different pixel scales of the two channels, 
$0.04''$/pixel and $0.12''$/pixel for \wfcuvis and \wfcir, respectively, they will not cover the same area on the sky.  
The data were obtained using either a 3- or 4-point standard dithering pattern for both channels.  For \wfcuvis we used 
the \uvisaperture, that is located next to the amplifier, with a post-flash to maximize the charge transfer efficiency (CTE) 
during read-out.  All imaging data are shown in Table~\ref{tb:hstimaging}.

The \wfcuvis and \wfcir data were obtained with the  \uvisaperture and \iraperture subarray, respectively.  \label{tb:hstimaging}}
\input{hst_imaging.tex}
\end{table}

The automatic \texttt{calwf3} reduction pipeline at the Space Telescope Science Institute, where the data were dark subtracted, 
flat-fielded and corrected for charge-transfer inefficiency, was used for all data. Different steps are, however, involved for the two
channels.  The individual images were then combined and corrected for geometric distortion using the \texttt{AstroDrizzle} software.

\subsection{Ground data}
In addition to the data already presented in \scipap, \geu was followed from the ground until it disappeared behind the Sun. We further observed the system in \jband, \hband and \ksband bands on UT June 16th 2017, after \geu had faded away, 
using laser guided adaptive optics (LGS-AO) with the NIRC2 instrument at the Keck~II telescope on Mauna Kea.  For the 
\jband and \hband bands we obtained 9~exposures in a dithering pattern, each with an integration time of 20\,s.  For the \ksband band, 
18~exposures of 65\,s were acquired. 

Standard near infrared reduction was applied where the individual images were first dark subtracted and flat fielded.  The flat 
frames were obtained using the same dome on-off technique as described in \scipap.  The sky background for each science 
frame was obtained from the images preceding and following each exposure, after first masking out the object.  
Together with data presented in \scipap this resulted in a total of 3~epochs for the NIRC2/\jband and 2~epochs for the 
NIRC2/\hband and NIRC2/\ksband bands, respectively.

We also obtained $riZYJH$ photometry of iPTF16geu with the multi-channel Reionization And Transients InfraRed camera \citep[RATIR;][]{butler2012} mounted on the 1.5-m Johnson telescope at the Mexican Observatorio Astronomico Nacional on Sierra San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico \citep{watson2012}. Typical observations include a series of X-s exposures in the ri bands and Y-s exposures in the ZY JH bands, with dithering between exposures. 
The RATIR data were reduced and coadded using standard CCD and IR processing techniques in IDL and Python, utilizing the online astrometry programs SExtractor and SWarp. Calibration was performed using field stars with reported fluxes in both 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006) and the SDSS Data Release 9 Catalogue (Ahn et al. 2012). % Template image subtracted ...

\section{Photometric analysis}
\label{sec:photometry}
\subsection{Forward modelling of the NIRC2 images}\label{sec:nirc2}
The LGS-AO NIRC2 images have the highest spatial resolution in our data set.  We can use the NIRC2 data to build a 
parametric model of the \geu system, including the \sn images, the host galaxy, and the lens.  The model we use is 
described in detail in \S\ref{sec:bgmodel}, and is only briefly summarized here. The shape of the lensing galaxy is modeled 
with a S\'ersic profile \citep{1963BAAA....6...41S} while the \sn images are 
modeled by the point-spread function (PSF) of the images.  The shape of the \sn host galaxy is described by the expansion 
in eq.~\eqref{eq:host}.  The full model is then fitted simultaneously to all data in for one NIRC2 filter 
at a time.  Some parameters,  such as the host and lens models and the position of the \sn images, are forced to be 
the same for all available images in a filter, while the fluxes of the \sn images are allowed to vary between the 
different epochs.  The exception is for images obtained in 2017 where all \sn fluxes are fixed to zero, which breaks the 
degeneracy between the PSFs and the background model.

We generally use the parametrisation by \citet{1969A&A.....3..455M} for the PSF.  When doing PSF photometry it is customary 
to first use isolated bright stars in the field to fit the PSF shape, and then fix the model.  However, since we are lacking 
isolated stars (or any objects but the \geu system) in the narrow field of view NIRC2 images, the PSF parameters is fitted 
together with the rest of the parmeters of the \geu model, including the \sn fluxes.  In other words, the \sn images is effectively 
used to determine the PSF shape.  We do not allow the PSF shape parameters to vary between the four \sn images.

Fitting the PSF shape together with the model will complicate the fitting procedure.  While the \geu model is not expected to vary with
time, the observing conditions will, and these are characterised by the differences in the PSFs we are attempting to fit together 
with the model.  We address this by iteratively fitting first the model, and then the PSF shape, to one of our epochs.  Once this fit has
converged, we use the resulting parameters as initial conditions for the simultaneous fit.  For each iteration in the final 
fitting procedure, the combined model then first convolved with the PSF before it is compared to the data.   For the reference 
images, that are lacking point-sources, we adopt a Gaussian PSF.  The width of the Gaussian is fitted together with the 
other parameters, and the degeneracy between the Gaussian width and and the background model is broken since the same 
background model is fitted to all epochs simultaneously. 

Examples of data and the fitted models are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nirc2}.  The fitted positions of the four \sn
images for the NIRC2 \jband-band are further presented Table~\ref{tb:snpos}, while the lens and host parameters are shown 
in Tables~\ref{tb:lensmodel}--\ref{tb:hostmodelwidth}. 
% The fitted \sn fluxes are presented in Table~\ref{tb:snflux}.  The PSFs  were placed at the locations along the fitted host 
% galaxy model ($r_H(\phi)$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:host}), while avoiding the \sn images.  We do not attempt to calibrate the fluxes 
% due to the absence of reference objects, in particular stars, in the NIRC2 images.

\end{table}

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:nirc2}, the model generally fits the data well.  Four \sn images are clearly visible in the \jband-band 
but from panel~d) we also see that the fit is not perfect.  Discrepancies can mainly be seen for the brightest \sn image, which are 
probably due to an imperfect PSF model, rather than an insufficient background model.  In other words, if the systematic PSF
uncertainties are known, the method can be used to obtain fluxes for the four \sn images.

From the radial profile plots in panels~f)--i) there is an apparent degeneracy between the host model and the \sn profiles given 
that their extrema coincide and have similar width.  However, recall that we only fit one parameter, $\sigma_H$, for the width of 
the host model, as explained in \S\ref{sec:bgmodel}, and the value of this parameter will mainly be determined by the pixels 
between the images located along the dashed circle in panel~b).  Further, by studying the profile along this circle, as shown in 
panel~e), we can conclude that the maximum of the host galaxy amplitude appears to be located between images (1) and (4),  
and the best fit model suggest that the background flux under the \sn images is either increasing or decreasing monotonically.
%This is again reassuring since it means that the pixels surrounding the \sn images can be used to determine the background 
%behind them.

Since we do not expect the image positions to change with neither time nor wavelength, we will fix the positions to the 
values in Table~\ref{tb:snpos} for the remaining of the analysis in this paper.  Using the \jband as the reference, is motivated 
both by the fact that the ratio between the \sn flux and the background is higher than for the other NIRC2 filters, and that we 
have two epochs where the \sn is active.

With the \sn positions fixed we move on to fit the host model for the remaining NIRC2 filters.  The fitted models to the 
\hband- and \ksband-band are shown in panels j)--m) in Figure~\ref{fig:nirc2}.  In the figure, the epochs when the \sn was 
active are shown together with the corresponding data.  The lens and host model parameters are presented in 
Tables~\ref{tb:lensmodel}--\ref{tb:hostmodelwidth}.

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{wfc3_patches_v2.pdf}
\end{figure*}
\subsection{WFC3 photometry}
The \sn photometry could be extracted from the \wfc data by using the same approach as in \S\ref{sec:nirc2}. However, given the 
lower resolution and the varying signal-to-noise of the host and lensing galaxy, all parameters could not be fitted for every filter.

For the \wfcuvis data, we face a similar challenge as for NIRC2.  The field of view is too small to include any isolated stars that 
could be used to model the PSF.  While conditions in space are relatively stable, the PSF of \wfc do vary over both the focal 
plane and in time, and a lot of effort has gone into understanding its characteristics 
\citep{2016wfc..rept...12A,2017arXiv170600386A}.  However, here we use a simple approach that is described in detail 
in \S~\ref{sec:wfcpsf} and only briefly summarised here.  For \wfcuvis we simultaneously fit the parameters of a Moffat profile 
to bright stars observed over time with the same subarray as \geu. The resulting fluxes are then compared to the corresponding 
values obtained from calibrated aperture photometry, following the prescription outlined in the \wfc data handbook.  The calculated 
estimated standard deviation, $0.02$--$0.10$~mag, from this comparison is used as the uncertainty of the method, and is 
added to the error budget of the \geu photometry.

The field-of-view for the \wfcir data is larger, and the bright star $20\arcsec$ North of \geu, was included in all observations.
We simultaneously fit a PSF model to all observations of this star, which result in a dispersion $<0.01$~mag with 
respect to the calibrated aperture photometry, if the last epoch in 2016 is excluded.  Since this epoch does not provide a significant 
contribution to the lightcurve it will also be excluded from the rest of the analysis.

Using one fixed PSF model for each filter, we can then follow the procedure from \S\ref{sec:nirc2} and \S\ref{sec:bgmodel}.  Since 
we assume that the PSF is the same for all epochs, we do not convolve the model before comparing with the data in the 
fitting routine, although doing this will result in similar results.  For \hsti, we fit the same parameters as described in \S\ref{sec:nirc2}.
For the remaining \wfcuvis filters this was not possible, and the lens parameters $n_S$, $\varepsilon$ and $\theta$ were then fixed to the
results obtained for \hsti.  For \hstr, we fit all host parameters, while a simplified model with only the first order of angular dependence 
was used for \hstb.  Further, the radial dependence and the width of the host model was fixed to the results obtained for \hsti.  
For \hstu, the host component was omitted completed.  The model complexity for each filter was determined by calculating the 
impact on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) as more parameters were added.  When additional parameters did not impact the BIC,
the previous model was selected.

For the \wfcir data it is more challenging to fit the full model due to the lower resolution, the broader PSF, and the lower flux ratio 
between the \sn images and the background.   The effective radius and the S\'ersic index for the lens can be constrained by the 
light beyond the Einstein right, but there is a degeneracy between the different components inside the ring.  Here, we fixed the 
$\varepsilon$ and $\theta$ parameters of the lens model for \hstj and \hsth to the corresponding NRIC2 results for the 
\jband and \hband, respectively, since the effective wavelengths of these filters are similar.  Similarly, the radial dependence and the width
of the host model were also fixed to the corresponding NIRC2 results.

Examples of data, model and normalised residual patches are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:wfcforward} for the different \wfc bands, while 
the fitted parameters for the background models are presented in Tables~\ref{tb:lensmodel}--\ref{tb:hostmodelwidth}.  
%  The fitted host normalisation parameters are shown in Table~\ref{tb:hostnorm}.
The resulting \sn fluxes from the simultaneous fitting is presented in Table~\ref{tb:resolvflux}.

In Table~\ref{tb:resolvflux} we present two different errors for each measurement.  The first error is the statistical fitting error that is obtained 
from the simultaneous fit for each filter.  However, from the residual patches in Figure~\ref{fig:wfcforward} we can 
see that the model does not always provide a perfect fit to the data.  In order to estimate the uncertainties from the imperfect model we 
place PSFs along the Einstein radius on the residual images to estimate the scatter of the fitted fluxes.  When this is is larger than the statistical uncertainty, we add the square root of the difference of the squares of the two uncertainties as a correlated error for each \sn image.

\subsection{Building lightcurves from subtracted images}
\ag{JOEL PLEASE ADD TEXT HERE}
Here we describe Joel's subtractions.... explain motivation, mainly due to model 
dependencies in the coarse pixel data....including pretty pictures.


\section{Lightcurve fitting model}
\label{sec:lcmodel}
We combine the ground based data with the resolved photometry from HST to fit for the global lightcurve parameters: lightcurve shape (or stretch, $s$), color excess from either intrinsic color variations or dimming by dust in the host galaxy. In addition, we use the multi-band lightcurves of the resolved 
\sn images to fit for the lightcurve peaks and time offsets between the four \sn images, as well as extinction in the lensing galaxy for each individual line of sight. 
Here, we describe the SN model constructed to derive the time-delay, magnification and extinction parameters for iPTF16geu. We construct a multiple-image model for an SN~Ia using \texttt{sncosmo} with a \texttt{Hsiao} model \citep{2007ApJ...663.1187H}, which is constructed from a large library of spectra for diverse SNe~Ia. We use the \texttt{Hsiao} model since iPTF16geu shows light curve properties consistent with normal SNe~Ia. 
SNe~Ia in the local universe show a characteristic NIR ($iYJHK$) light curve morphology \citep{1996AJ....112.2438H,2010AJ....139..120F}.  Unlike in the optical, where the light curves decline after peak, in the NIR, SNe~Ia rebrighten 2-3 weeks after the $B$-band maximum. This feature has also been seen in well-studied intermediate-$z$ SNe \citep[e.g., see][]{2000ApJ...536...62R}. iPTF16geu shows a distinct second maxmium in the observer frame F110W and F160W filters (corresponding to re. Accounting for time-dilation and K-correction, we find that the time of the second maximum ($t_2$)  29.3 $\pm$ 1.1 days after $B$-band maximum, consistent with the median $J$-band (the corresponding rest-frame filter) $t_2$ for nearby, normal, SNe~Ia \citep{2012A&A...537A..57B, 2015MNRAS.448.1345D}. Since $t_2$ only depends on the redshift but not the distance, this further justifies the choice of using a normal SN~Ia model to fit the iPTF16geu light curves. 
We fit the model to the observations using a $\chi^2$ likelihood with two terms for the ground based and the HST data. For the ground based data we compare the sum of the models to the observations, whereas for the HST data we compare the individual images, where $F$ is the flux, $t$ is the epoch of the SN~Ia light curve, $N$ is the number of images and $\lambda$ is the effective wavelength of each filter. 

Along with the above mentioned host and lens galaxy extinction correction, we also correct for Milky Way (MW) dust, assuming the standard  reddening law \citep[][hereafter, CCM89]{1989ApJ...345..245C} for the MW, with $R_V = 3.1$. For the host and lens galaxies, we follow \citet{Amanullah:2015bj} and use a dust law from \citet[][hereafter, F99]{Fitzpatrick:1999dx}. For our fiducial analysis, we fix the F99 dust correction $R_V$ to 2. 
This is using the slope of the luminosity-colour relation ($\beta \sim 3$, hence, $R_V \sim 2$) from the most updated compilations of cosmological samples \citep[see;][]{2018ApJ...859..101S,2018arXiv181102374D}. Since iPTF16geu shows light curve and spectroscopic features similar to core-normal SNe~Ia \citep{2018MNRAS.473.4257C} which are used for constraining cosmology, we can use the mean $R_V$ from the cosmological compilations for fitting the colour excess for iPTF16geu. Hence, in our model fit, we include the following parameters 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The stretch, s, for the SN
    \item The colour excess, $E(B-V)$ in the host galaxy
    \item The colour excess, $E(B-V)$ for the individual images in the lens galaxy 
    \item The time of maximum $t_{0}$ for each of the four images, and hence, the time-delays between the images
    \item The magnification for each of the four images
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:chi}
\begin{aligned}
\chi ^2 &= \sum_{\lambda}^{\mathrm{Ground}}\frac{\left[\left(\sum_i^{N} F_i^{model}(t,\lambda)\right)-F^{data}(t,\lambda)\right]^2}{\sigma^2(t,\lambda)}+ \\
&\quad \sum_{\lambda}^{\mathrm{HST}}\sum_i^{N}\frac{\left[F_i^{model}(t,\lambda)-F_i^{data}(t,\lambda)\right]^2}{\sigma_i^2(t,\lambda)},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We fit this model to the data using a nested sampling software, \texttt{nestle} implemented in \texttt{sncosmo}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this section, we present the results of fitting the multiple-image SN model described in Section~\ref{sec:lcmodel} to the observations of iPTF16geu. In our analyses, we add an additional error term corresponding to 6$\%$ of the flux to the diagonal terms of the error covariance matrix such that the reduced $\chi^2$ for the fit is $\sim 1$. 
 We present the resulting values of the time-delays between the images (Section~\ref{ssec-time_delay}) and the properties of the extinction due to dust in the host and lens galaxies (Section~\ref{ssec-extinction}). For the fiducial case we fit the time of maximum, amplitudes and colour excesses for the four SN images as well as the total to selection absorption, $R_V$ in the lens galaxy and the colour excess in the host galaxy. 








\subsection{Differential extinction and lensing magnification}
\label{ssec-extinction}
Here we present the properties of extinction of  iPTF16geu due to the dust in the host and the lens galaxies as well as the magnification of each image relative to a normal SNe~Ia at the redshift of the source (i.e. $z = 0.409$). As described in Section~\ref{sec:lcmodel}, for our fiducial case, we fix the $R_V$ in the host and lens galaxies to 2, the best fit value for SNe~Ia used in cosmology. 
The resulting parameters from the fit are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:params}. We assume that the host extinction is the same for each image since the difference in the light travel path is very small ($\sim$ few pc) and we do not expect the dust properties to varying significantly on those timescales. We find host $E(B-V)$ of 0.045 $\pm 0.039$, consistent with no reddening at $< 2 \sigma$. The $E(B-V)$ in the Images 1,2,3,4 is 0.311 ($\pm$ 0.056), 0.293 ($\pm$ 0.078), 0.524 ($\pm$ 0.165) and 1.082 ($\sim$ 0.263) respectively. Hence, there is moderate extinction in the first three images, and a significant amount of reddening in Image 4.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{amplif_dist_forpaper_linscale.png}
    \caption{The posterior distribution for the total magnification fitting the multiple-image \texttt{sncosmo} model described in the text. The median value is 63.8 with a 68$\%$ credible region between (58.7, 66.81).}
    \label{fig:amp}
\end{figure}

We also test the impact of altering the assumption on $R_V$. For a fixed $R_V = 3.1$, corresponding to the MW value, in both the host and lens galaxies, we find host $E(B-V)$ of 0.039 ($\pm$ 0.047) and lens $E(B-V)$ for Images 1,2,3,4 to be 0.215 ($\pm$ 0.057), 0.204 ($\pm$ 0.069), 0.264 ($\pm$ 0.113), 0.603 ($\pm$ 0.176). 
We also let the $R_V$ in the lens galaxy as a free parameter. The data indicate low lens $R_V < 1.8$ at 95 $\%$ C.L. 

We also compute the total amplification for iPTF16geu and the magnification of each image. For our fiducial case with both host and lens galaxy $R_V = 2$, we obtain an median amplification of 63.80 with a 68$\%$ credible region of (58.32, 67.70). The individual images are magnified by -3.911, -2.868, -2.189, -2.109 magnitudes respectively. We find that the magnification for iPTF16geu is robust to the assumption on the $R_V$ for the host and lens galaxies (see Table~\ref{tab:params} for individual magnifications for different $R_V$ assumptions).

\end{figure*}
 \subsection{Time-delays}
\label{ssec-time_delay}
We fit the time of maximum for the four images and calculate the time-delay for images 2,3,4 relative to Image 1  $t_{01}$, $t_{02}$, $t_{03}$, $t_{04}$. The summary of the parameter values is presented in Table~\ref{tab:params}. The time-delays for the three images 2,3,4 relative to Image 1 are -0.811, -2.608 and -0.164 days respectively. However, due to the large uncertainties in constraining the time-delays, they are consistent with a zero day time delay at the 95$\%$ C.L. 
We also derive time-delays from the light curves without assuming an SN model. SNe~Ia have a distinct light curve morphology showing a second maximum $\sim$ few weeks after the first, we use the timing of this feature to derive constraints on $\Delta_t$. Since Images 1 and 2 are the brightest, the NIR light curves only have high enough signal to noise for these two images to derive a time-delay. We use two different methods to fit the data. Firstly, we derive $\Delta_{\rm t}$ using a Gaussian Process (GP) smoothing to the light curve. We use the Matern32 kernel implemented within the \texttt{GPy} package \citep{gpy2014}.
The model independent constraints are also consistent with the $\sim$ 1 day time delay derived from fitting the \texttt{sncosmo} model to the data. 

\section{Lensing from sub-structures}
\label{sec:substructure}
The fact that \geu exploded very close to the inner caustic of the lens, makes the predicted images for a smooth lens similar in terms of radial position, magnification and arrival time. 
In \citet{2017Sci...356..291G}, the total magnification of the SN images could not be well constrained, but
the adopted lens halo predicted brightness differences between the SN images in disagreement with observations.
Taking advantage of the improved observational constraints since then, uncertainties in the mass, ellipticity and orientation of the lens galaxy are decreased by a factor $\sim 7$ (M{\"o}rtsell et al. in prep).
The slope of the lens density, $\rho\propto r^{-n}$ where $r^2=\theta_1^2+\theta_2^2$, is still only very loosely constrained, and when varying $n$, the image flux ratios vary little, but their total flux much more. The model consistently predicts image 4 to be the brightest, with slightly lower, similar fluxes for the other three images. 
The fact that the predicted flux ratios are consistently off from the observed values, indicates the need of additional (de)magnification for at least two of the images. A possible resolution is that $n\sim 1.7$, slightly shallower than an isothermal sphere for which $n=2,$ with image 1 magnified by an additional $\Delta m\sim 1$, and image 4 demagnified by the same amount from substructure in the galaxy.

From Table~\ref{tab:params}, we report the values of the magnifications for each individual image. We find that Image 1 is the brightest and 4 is the faintest. Lens models of the system \citep[e.g.][M{\"o}rtsell et al. in prep.]{2017ApJ...835L..25M} suggest that the SN images would have very similar brightnesses since the SN images are symmetric around the lens. We test whether this could be a result of differential extinction, i.e. a difference in the $R_V$ for the dust in the region around Images 1 and 4. Assuming a different $R_V$ for Images 1 and 4, in this case setting it to extreme values of $R_V = 1$ and $R_V = 5$ for Images 1 and 4 respectively, we find that Image 4 is still fainter than Image 1 by a factor $\sim$ 6 and the best fit value compensates for the high input $R_V$ with a lower inferred $E(B-V)$. Moreover, we also fitted for two different $R_V$'s in the lens, one for Images 1,2,3 and a separate $R_V$ for Image 4. For this case, we get similar values for both $R_V$'s and hence, Image 4 is still $\sim$ 9 times fainter than Image 1.  Hence, differential extinction is an unlikely explanation for the discrepancy between the observed and modelled image brightness ratios. Recent studies in the literature study the impact of microlensing on the inferred time-delay, accounting for the 3D source geometry, and find a bias of a few tenths of a day \citep{2019A&A...621A..55B}. We note that the error on our inferred time-delays is $\sim 1$ day hence, the microlensing bias has a subdominant contribution to the error budget.
%Additionally, we fit for two different $R_V$'s in the lens galaxy, one for Image 1 and the other for Images 2,3,4. For this case, Image 4 is $\sim$ a factor 9 fainter than Image 1, since the $R_V$ for Image 4 is $1.2 \pm 0.3$ whereas the best fit $R_V$ of Image 1 $2.9 \sim 0.30$. This conclusion is consistent with the symmetry of the system which would indicate that differential extinction is unlikely.

\section{Implications for observations of future strongly lensed \sn}
\label{sec:forecast}
We note here that the resolved observations of the multiple images only began $\sim$ 2 weeks after maximum light, hence, the peak in the HST filters is not well determined. Here, we analyse what the constraints on the time-delay and extinction parameters would be if we were to obtain observations close to the peak. 
We use the best fit model for iPTF16geu to extrapolate the observations near maximum light. We generate ten observations uniformly in the phase region between 10 and 30 days from the first iPTF observation. We conservatively assume an error on each point to be drawn from a uniform distribution given by the errors on the observed post-maximum epochs. Since the SN is brighter at maximum light we would expect smaller errors on the fluxes. Under these assumptions we fit the above mentioned \texttt{sncosmo} model to the simulated data. 
We find that the maximum light data significantly improve the constraints on the time delays, allowing a $\sim$ 17$\%$ measurement of the time delay, or 4 hour per day which is a significant improvement compared to the 70$\%$ errors from the current measurements. We also find that the data will improve our constraints on the $E(B-V)$ for the images 2, 3, 4 by a factor 3.5, 2.5 and 6, making the constraints on the extinction parameters significantly more robust.  Recent studies in the literature find that microlensing from substructures can impact the time-delay measurement, adding an uncertainty of a fraction of day. We note that since the error on $\Delta_t$ from the SN model fit is $\sim 1 day$, the microlensing error is likely to be subdominant to the total error budget.




\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we present ground-based and HST follow-up of the first resolved, multiply-imaged gravitationally lensed SNe~Ia, iPTF16geu. Fitting a multiple image SN~Ia model to the data we were able to derive the total amplification, properties of extinction for each image and time-delays between the images. Accounting for the extinction in the individual images, we find that iPTF16geu is amplified by $63.8^{+3.9}_{-5.5}$ times relative to a normal SN~Ia at the redshift of the source. Since this value accounts for the extinction in each image separately, it is higher than the first estimate provided in G17. Assuming an $R_V =2$ extinction law in the host and lens galaxies, we find an $E(B-V) \sim 0.3$ in Images 1 and 2 $\sim 0.5$ mag in Image 3 and $\sim 1 mag$ in Image 4. 
From the multiple-image model fit, we find that time-delay of images 2,3,4 relative to image 1 to be -0.811 ($\pm$ 0.828), -2.947 ($\pm$ 1.416) and (-0.164 $\pm$ 2.008), consistent with the limits presented in G17 and the model predictions in \citep{2017ApJ...835L..25M}. We use model independent smoothing techniques to derive the time-delay from the observations of the NIR second maximum and find consistent results with the multiple-image model fit. Furthermore, the total amplification and the time-delay estimates are robust to the assumptions on the host and lens $R_V$. 
We find that the observed difference in the brightness of Images 1 and 2 relative to images 3 and 4 is discrepant with model prediction which suggest a similar brightness for all images. Differential extinction is not sufficient to explain the observed discrepancy. This discrepancy can be possibly resolved with a slope shallower than the isothermal sphere ($n < 2$) for the lens model and substructure to demagnify images 3 and 4. Further details are presented in an accompanying paper (M{\"o}rtsell et al. in prep). Finally, we present forecasts for observations of lensed SNe discovered in the future and find that $\sim 10$ HST observations of multiple-image glSNe~Ia around maximum light will improve the existing constraints on time-delays by a factor $\sim$ 3 and on extinction by upto a factor $\sim 6$.

\section{Forward modelling of the \geu images}
\label{sec:bgmodel}
A model,  $F(r,\phi)$, of the observed 2D shape of the \geu system in a broadband image, can be expressed as a 
combination of parametric lens and host models, $L(r,\phi)$ and $H(r,\phi)$, and the point spread function (PSF) of the 
image as
\begin{eqnarray*}
	F(r,\phi) & = & A_n\cdot PSF\otimes \left[L(r,\phi) + H(r,\phi)\right] +\\
	& + & \sum\limits_{i=1}^{4}\left( f_{i}^{(n)} PSF(r_i,\phi_i) \right)+ B_n
\end{eqnarray*}
where the coordinates $(r,\phi)$ are defined with respect to the center (which are treated as nuisance parameters in the fit)
of the system in each image $n$, and the angle $0 \leq \phi < 2\pi$ runs from North towards East.  The index, $i=1,2,3,4$ runs 
over the four SN images, and $n$ runs over all observed epochs for a given band.  Further, $f_{i}^{(n)}$ and $(r_i,\phi_i)$ are 
the fluxes and coordinates of the SN images.  The amplitude, $A_n$, can be used to account for varying photometric 
calibration, but must be kept fixed for at least one image in each band in order to break the degeneracy between the  
parameters for $L$ and $H$.  We also allow for the background, $B_n$ to vary between images. 

The lens, $L$, is modelled by a S\'ersic profile \citep{1963BAAA....6...41S}
\begin{equation}
	L(r,\phi) = S^{n_S}(r,\phi) = f_S\cdot \exp\left\{-b_n\left[\left(\frac{r_S(\theta,\epsilon;\phi)}{r_e}\right)^\frac{1}{2n_S} - 1\right]\right\}\,
	\label{eq:lens}
\end{equation}
where $r_S(\theta,\epsilon;\phi)$, is generalized to allow for an elliptical model with ellipticity, $\epsilon$, and rotation, $\theta$.  Here,
$b_n$ (solved for numerically) is defined such that $r_e$ contains half of the total luminosity , $f_S$ is the intensity, and $n_S$ is
the S\'ersic index.  
%In the cases where this model is not sufficient for describing the nucleus of the lensing galaxy we also add an 
%exponential, $S^1(r,\phi)$, with an effective radius, $r_\mathrm{exp}$, but with the same ellipticity and orientation 
%as for $S^{n_S}(r,\phi)$.

The host galaxy is expressed as a Gaussian profile according to
\begin{equation}
	H(x,y) = h\cdot f_H(\phi)\cdot\exp\left\{-\frac{(r - r_H(\phi))^2}{2\sigma_H^2}\right\}\, ,\label{eq:host}
\end{equation}
where  the amplitude, $f_H(\phi)$ and radius, $r_H(\phi)$ are defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
f_H(\phi) & = & \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum\limits_{j=1}^3 a_j\cdot\sin(j\phi) + b_j\cdot\cos(j\phi)\, ,\label{eq:hostflux} \\ 
r_H(\phi) & = & \frac{c_0}{2} +  c_1\cdot\sin(\phi) + d_1\cdot\cos(\phi)\, .\label{eq:hostradius}
% \sigma_H(\phi) & = & \frac{g_0}{2} + \sum\limits_{j=1}^3 g_j\cdot\sin(j\phi) + h_j\cdot\cos(j\phi)\, .
\end{eqnarray}
The parameter $h$, and the parameters $a_0, a_j, b_j$ cannot be fitted simultaneously.  The former is only allowed as a free parameter
for \wfcir when $a_0, a_j, b_j$ is fixed to the solution for the LGS-AO data.

We also allow for a rotation, $\delta_n$ of the full system, i.e. $\phi \rightarrow \phi + \delta_n$ between images.  These parameters 
must be fixed for at least one image to break the degeneracy with the angle dependent model parameters.

In its most general implementation the number of free parameters of the model can be:
\begin{itemize}
\item $2\times n + (n-1)$ for the position and rotation in each image
\item $4\times 3 \times n$ for the SN fluxes and positions
\item $n-1$ for the normalization of the model in each image
\item $5$ for the lens model
\item $11$ for the host model
\end{itemize}
which results in a total of $14 + 16n$ parameters.  However, when fitting this model to the data we will generally require 
that the SN positions are the same between different filters.  
%In practice, we also applied an iterative approach where the complexity of the model was increased in each step and the Bayesian 
%Information Criterion \citep[BIC,][]{schwarz1978} was calculated.  The more complex model was only kept if  $\Delta\mathrm{BIC}>10$.

\section{Empirical point-spread function model for \wfc}
\label{sec:wfcpsf}
Although the shape and variability of the point-spread-function (PSF) of \wfc has been studied in great detail 
\citep{2016wfc..rept...12A,2017arXiv170600386A}, a simple time-independent PSF model will be used here.  
We fit the profile,
\[
	PSF(x,y;A,\alpha,\gamma) = A\cdot \frac{\alpha - 1}{\pi\gamma^2}\left[1 + \left(\frac{x^2 + y^2}{\gamma^2}\right)\right]^{-\alpha}\,,
\]
as described by \citet{1969A&A.....3..455M},  where, $x$ and $y$ are pixel coordinates and $A$, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are 
free parameters.  The profile is fitted to bright isolated stars observed between 2010 and 2017 and with the same subarray, 
\uvisaperture, used for the \geu.  The data are also drizzled to the same resolution, and with the same kernel as for our science 
observations.  

The \wfcir observations of \geu was obtained with a larger field-of-view than \wfcuvis as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:psfnir}, and 
included a bright, but unsaturated, star $\sim20\arcsec$ North of the object.  The star was visible in all \wfcir and bands and
could be used to determine the PSF shape for these filters using the same approach as for \wfcuvis. 
%% For the WFC3/IR observations of iPTF16geu we offset the pointing with about 20" (160 pixels) from the center to avoid having
%% the nearby bright star to fall on the detector.  On the other hand the, for the observations of standard stars used for 
%% deriving the PSF the pointing was never chosen to that the star fell in the center. All standard star observations were obtained using
%% smaller 256x256 subarray.

The PSF fit is carried out to all data in a given filter.  While the amplitude, $A$, is fitted to each exposure, the parameters, 
$\alpha$ and $\gamma$, are only allowed to vary between different filters.   The fitted amplitudes of each star are then compared to the 
corresponding value obtained from aperture photometry.  For the latter we follow the guidelines in the \wfc data handbook 
\citep{wfc3handbook} and always use a fixed aperture radius of $0.4\arcsec$, for which zero points have been derived.  
The two sets of values are used both to calculate the aperture correction for the PSF photometry and to assess the quality of this simple 
time-independent PSF model.  The later is quantified by the estimated standard deviation between the PSF and and aperture
photometry for all observations in a given filter.  These values are then added in quadrature to the photometry error budget.

The fitted parameters and the $\sigma$ values are given in Table~\ref{tb:psf} for the different filters.  For the \wfcir data the last 
epoch from Nov 22, 2016 was excluded from the fits since this was found to deviate significantly from the others.
% and a  couple of examples of profile fits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:psf}.

\section{tab of \geu}
Here we present the data tables that the the analysis in this paper is based on.

\begin{landscape}
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{%
		Derived photometry for the four lensed \sn images.  The first error quoted for each measurement is the statistical
		uncertainty that is expected to uncorrelated between epochs.  This includes the expected PSF variations discussed
		in \S\ref{sec:wfcpsf}.  The second error, is the systematic error from the background model fit discussed in the text.
		This is will be correlated for measurements obtained with the same filter.
